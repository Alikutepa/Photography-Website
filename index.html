    <h1>Juliana's View - My Backyard Farm</h1>
    <p>This is a photography website that showcases pictures that are <strong>important</strong> to me.</p>
    <p>I love animals, and that is one of the reason why I have kept several "pets". I have reared chicken, I have a puppy, a kitten, and three bunnies. I love my chicken because they provide me with fresh produce like eggs and meat. It is also fascinating to watch them grow from chicks to fully grown chicken who can fend for themselves.<in>It is important to note that they are actually very intelligent because they recognize new faces. If someone new was to go near their coop, they'd make noise to alert me.</in></p>
    <p>Through rearing chicken, I have learnt that they use different vocalizations to pass different messages.</p>
