            <p>I dont always take selfies, but when I do, I make sure it is <em>magazine cover worthy.!- wishful thinking. To be honest, I do it to my face's best ability. </em></p>

            <img src="./images/best pupies.jpeg" alt="Pets" width="" height="">
            <p>I love animals, and that is one of the reason why I have kept several "pets". I have reared chicken, I have a puppy, a kitten, and three bunnies. I love my chicken because they provide me with fresh produce like eggs and meat. My kitten, <em>Bubbles</em> is my closest companion. She follows me everywhere I go in the house and we get to play some games and there's never a dull moment with her in the house. For my bunnies, who are yet to be named, i loved them just for the simple reason that they are <strong>extremely cute</strong></in></p>

            <img src="./images/black-forest-cake-thumb.webp" alt="Baking pics" width="50%" height="30%">
            <p>During my free time, I bake. It is always fun to play around with flavours and come up with different recipes for my cakes. Its a hobbby that has taught me persistence because cake decoration does not always come out as you had envisioned and you then have to do it all over again.</p>

        <h1>Juliana's View - My Backyard Farm</h1>
    <p>This is a photography website that showcases pictures that are <strong>important</strong> to me.</p>
    
    <p>Through rearing chicken, I have learnt that they use different vocalizations to pass different messages.</p>
